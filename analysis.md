## üü¢ High Score Wallets (Score ‚â• 700)

Count: 965 wallets

### Key Characteristics:
- Avg. Transactions: ~12.8  
- Avg. Total Volume (USD): ~$2,315  
- Avg. Activity Span: ~34.7 days  
- Avg. Repay-to-Borrow Ratio: ~0.91  
- Avg. Liquidation Ratio: ~0.007

**Interpretation**:
These wallets show strong repayment behavior, low liquidation risk, consistent activity over weeks, and diverse asset interactions‚Äîindicating reliability.

## üî¥ Low Score Wallets (Score ‚â§ 300)

Count: 11 wallets

### Key Characteristics:
- Avg. Transactions: ~2.1  
- Avg. Total Volume (USD): ~$78  
- Avg. Activity Span: ~1.4 days  
- Round Number Ratio: ~0.82  
- Repetitive Pattern Score: ~0.79

Interpretation:
These wallets exhibit strong signs of bot-like or spammy behavior‚Äîmany transactions use round numbers, follow repetitive action patterns, and occur in short time spans.

---

## üîç Observations

- No wallets scored above 900 ‚Äî this suggests high scores are difficult to attain due to strict behavioral consistency and anomaly detection.
- Round number patterns are a strong signal of bot activity and are penalized in scoring.
- High scoring wallets exhibit human-like behavior, higher diversity, and longer engagement durations.
- Activity span and transaction variance play a significant role in differentiating low- and high-score clusters.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This model provides a transparent, extensible framework for credit risk assessment in DeFi. With further improvements (e.g., time-series modeling, protocol-specific metrics), it can evolve into a full-fledged DeFi credit engine.
